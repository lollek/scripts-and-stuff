FIBONACCI

Calculate numbers from the fibonacci sequence
If the application is called without arguments, it should print them out like
this (where a TAB separates 0 and 55):

0       55
1       89
1       144
2       233
3       377
5       610
8       987
13      1597
21      2584
34      4181

If the application is called with an argument, it should calculate the nth
fibonacci, where n is the number in the argument.

If n < 0, the argument is a letter, etc, the result is undefined
